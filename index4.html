       <p><big>HTTP is a protocol used for communication between clients and servers. Clients send requests to servers, which respond with data packets. The communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses. HTTP is a half-duplex protocol used for communication between clients and web servers. It serves as the foundation for data exchange on the World Wide Web</big></p>
