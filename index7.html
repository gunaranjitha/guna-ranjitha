        <br>
        <p><big>HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol used for secure communication over the internet. HTTPS is an extension of HTTP, which is the protocol used for transferring data over the internet. The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS uses encryption to protect the data being transferred. This encryption ensures that the data cannot be intercepted or modified by third parties. HTTPS is used for secure transactions such as online banking, e-commerce, and other sensitive data transfers1.</big></p>
