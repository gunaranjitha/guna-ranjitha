        <p><big>HTTP/2 is a protocol used for transferring data over the internet. It is the successor to HTTP/1.1 and was designed to improve the performance of HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 uses a binary format for data transfer, which is more efficient than the text-based format used by HTTP/1.1. It also allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, reducing the number of connections required between the client and server. HTTP/2 is supported by most modern web browsers and servers</big></p>
